        - `print()` can be used to print multiple values at once by separating them with a comma.

# Printing to the console
st.header("3.1: Printing to the console")
st.markdown("""
            The most basic way to output information is to use the `print()` function. Whenever you run a Python script, a terminal window will open up. This terminal is how Python executes your code and also displays certain outputs. `print()` is Python's primary way to output information to this terminal (also called the console).

            For most values, `print()` will output the value as is. For example, if we have `print(123)`, the output will be `123`. However, the main exception is with strings, where `print()` will not output the quotes that enclose the string. For example, if we have `print('Hello, world!')`, the output will be `Hello, world!`.

            ```python
            print(123)
            ```

            Note in the example above, there is no variable involved. `print()` doesn't give you a value to use, it just outputs the value you give it.

            What if you wanted to `print` multiple values (usually mutliple variables) out at the same time? Writing out one `print()` for each value would be tedious and inefficient. Instead, you can use a comma to separate the values you want to print within the `print()` function:

            ```python
            name_one = "Alana"

# Extra parameters for print()
st.header("3.3: Adjusting `print()` behavior")
st.markdown("""
            The `print()` function has a few extra parameters that can be used to adjust its behavior. These parameters are optional, and can be used to modify the default behavior of `print()`.

            **`sep` parameter**: This parameter is used to specify the separator between the values you want to print. For example, if we have `print(123, 456, sep='-')`, the output will be `123-456`. The default value of `sep` is a space.

            **`end` parameter**: This parameter is used to specify the string to print at the end of the output. For example, if we have `print(123, 456, end='-')`, the output will be `123-456-`. Note that the default value of `end` is `'\\n'`, which means that the output will be printed on a new line.

            They are used by adding them after the values we want to print:

            ```python
            print(123, 456, sep='-', end='+')
            ```

            The output will be:

            ```
            123-456+
            ```

            You can choose to use only `sep`, only `end`, both, or neither. If you do choose to use at least one of these parameters, make sure that you add them after all the values you want to print.

            So far, we've been printing values by inserting them directly into the `print()` function. However, this is not the only way to print values. We can also use f-strings to print values.

            F-strings are a way to embed variables in strings. They are created by prefixing the string with `f` and then using curly braces to embed the variable name.

            ```python
            name = "Tony"
            print(f"Hello, {name}!")

            What if you wanted to control how the value is embedded in the string? For example, what if you wanted to print a number with a certain number of decimal places? Or what if you wanted to ensure a certain alignment or spacing of a string?

            The `:` character helps define different formatting options for the value directly before it. The table below shows some of the most common formatting options:

    {

Replace `a` to change which character is used to fill the space. Remove `a` just to use blank space as the filler. The alignment option though can be applied to both numbers and strings."

st.markdown("""
            There are many more formatting options available, but these are the most common ones. You can find a full list of formatting options [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language). The three shown are the three that I believe are the most useful right away. For example, you can use `:,"` just to add commas to a number (e.g. `100000` becomes `100,000`). Feel free to experiment with all the formatting options for your needs!

            Note that the value to be formatted is placed immediately before the `:` character. For example, if we have `print(f"{100000:,}")`, the output will be `100,000`. Instead of some quiz questions, play with the code below to see how the formatting options work:
