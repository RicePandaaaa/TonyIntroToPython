            A variable is what we use to store information in a program. If the information can be represented as some sort of tangible value or object (e.g. a number or some text), then we can store in a variable. For Python to understand the information being stored, it has specific data types that it can work with. The core three are `int`, `float`, and `str`.

            `int` and `float` are used to store numbers. `int` is used to store **int**eger values, while `float` is used to store **float**ing point values (decimal numbers). An example of an `int` is `1`, while an example of a `float` is `1.5`. Note that as long as the number has a decimal point, it will be stored as a `float`, even if the number itself could be rewritten as an `int` (e.g. `1.0` is a `float` even though 1 does not inherently have a fractional part).

# String data type

            `str` is used to store **string** values. A string is a sequence of characters. An example of a `str` is `"Hello, world!"`. Notice the use of quotes to indicate that the value is a string. These quotes are not part of the string itself, but are used to indicate that the value is a string. Without these quotes, Python would think you are typing some code instead. Also notice that the quotes can be single or double quotes, but they must be consistent (i.e. the string must be enclosed in the same type of quotes).

For example, `"Hello, world!"` is a valid `str` because the string is enclosed in double quotes, but `"Hello, world!"` is not a valid `str` because the string is enclosed in double quotes and contains a double quote.

st.markdown("""
            Often strings can look empty but are actually not. The most common mistake is to consider whitespaces as just blank space. However, remember that even a whitespace is still considered to be a character. This means that `" "` is a valid `str` value, and is not empty. A way to think about the whitespace is that it takes up space, and thus is a character.

            The other confusion comes with numbers. For example, `"123"` is a `str` value, not an `int` or `float` value. Although the contents of the string is what we would consider a number, Python sees the quotes and treats the contents as characters. It just happens that those characters form a number to us. Now we can leverage this to convert strings into actual numbers, which we will cover in the "Typecasting" section later on.

# Variable assignment
st.header("Variable Assignment")

            To store these values in a variable, the variable needs to be created and assigned. The syntax for this is:

            variable_name = value
            ```

            If `variable_name` already exists, it will be overwritten with the new value. Otherwise, a new variable will be created with that value. Notice that the variable name is on the left side of the assignment operator (`=`) and the value is on the right side. This is *always* the case, and is a key concept to remember when programming.

            Note that if a variable is written on the right side, then it is assumed that we want to assign the *value* of that variable to the variable on the left. For example, if we have `x = 1` and `y = x`, then `y` will be assigned the value `1`.

# Naming conventions

            When naming variables, there are some rules to follow to avoid errors and confusion with either Python or other programmers. Some "rules" are stylistic in nature: they just follow what other programmers done have for a while, and it helps make your code more readable. Other rules however are extremely strict and will cause errors or very unexpected behaviors if not followed.

# Hard rules

            As previously said, some rules, if ignored, will cause errors or very unexpected behaviors. These are the hard rules that you must follow:

            - Variable names can **only** contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)
            - Variable names cannot start with a number
            - Variable names cannot be the same as a Python keyword
            - Variable names cannot be the same as a built-in function name

            That above list is not *entirely* exhaustive, but it works well enough. If you are unsure about whether a variable name is valid, you can always check the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers).

            These rules are more like guidelines. They are not enforced by Python, but it is a good idea to follow them to make your code more readable.

            - Variable names should be short and concise
            - Variable names for constant values should be in all caps
            - Be consistent in how spacing is used:
              - Either use underscores (e.g. `my_variable`)
              - Or use camel case (e.g. `myVariable`)

# Casting to a different data type
st.header("Typecasting")
st.markdown("""
            We can also convert between data types using the `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` functions. This is particularly useful when we want to do something with a value that is only possible for certain data types. For example, we can use `int()` to conver a string into an integer, so we can do math.

            These three functions return an entirely new value, and do not modify the original value that they are called on. For example, if we have `x = '123'` and we call `int(x)`, then `x` will still be `'123'` and the function will return `123` (the integer value of the string `'123'`).

            When converting a `float` to an `int`, the decimal point and anything after it is removed. For example, `int(1.9999)` will return `1`. When converting any number to a string, just add quotes around the number. For example, `str(1.0)` will return `\"1.0\"`.

            We know that converting a `float` to an `int` will remove the decimal point and anything after it, but what happens if you try to convert a string that contains a decimal number to an `int`? An error occurs!

            When you convert a string to an `int`, you need to see if the value without the quotes is an integer. For example, `\"123.45\"` without the quotes is `123.45`, which is not an integer. This means that `int(\"123.45\")` will return an error. Do not make the assumption that `int()` will also truncate the decimal point for you. You would need to convert to a `float` first and then to an `int` to get the integer part of the number. Below shows the side by side comparison of the incorrect and correct way to do this conversion.

            # Incorrect
